# Step-by-Step Azure Function Setup

This step-by-step instruction guides you through the process of setting up a complete Azure Function that will acquire Threat Intelligence indicators from Orange Cyberdefense's Datalake, sanitize it, then writes it to Microsoft Sentinel instance.

The full setup consists of several Azure components:

1. **App Registration** - This app will get the permissions to write data to the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table of Sentinel
2. **Keyvault** - contains the keys to automatically authenticate with the app registration
3. **Function** - contains the scripts to retrieve information from Datalake in interval, format it in _STIX format_ and then push it in Sentinel through the app registration

## Prerequisities

- An Azure Subscription
- A Microsoft Sentinel Instance
- [Threat Intelligence Solution installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/azure/sentinel/connect-threat-intelligence-upload-api#enable-the-threat-intelligence-upload-indicators-api-data-connector-in-microsoft-sentinel) on the Microsoft Sentinel workspace

## App Registration

This is how to create and configure the app registration:

1. Open Azure via https://portal.azure.com
2. Go to the service App Registrations
3. Make a new registration
4. Give the new app a descriptive name, for instance: _datalake2sentinel_. Other settings can be left to default values.
5. (Optional) If you plan to use a secret credential to authenticate to the app:
   1. Click after creating the app registration in the overview page under Client credentials on _add a certificate or secret_
   2. Click under Client secrets on _New client secret_
   3. Give a description, for instance _D2S Azure Function_ and leave the recommended expiry value
   4. Copy the value of the new Client Secret, which need to be stored in an Azure Key Vault
6. [Add the created app registration to the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role](https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/azure/sentinel/connect-threat-intelligence-upload-api#assign-a-role-to-the-application) on the relevant workspace.

## Keyvault

This is how to create a Key Vault and store the secret value in it:

1. Go to the service _Key vaults_
2. Click _Create key vault_
3. Configure the Key vault as you wish, pay attention to the region in which it is stored, for instance "France Central"

### Formatting the Secret value

From above App Registration, 4 elements are required to store in Keyvault a value in the correct format to make the script able to properly make use of the app.

- **TENANT_ID** = the value stated at _Directory (tenant) ID_ in the App Registration overview
- **CLIENT_ID** = the value stated at _Application (client) ID_ in the App Registration overview
- (Only if using a secret) **CLIENT_CREDENTIAL** = the value you copied in the last step in creating the App Registration
- **WORKSPACE_ID** = the workspace id of the Sentinel workspace you want to write to

The combined value that should be stored in the Keyvault, is as follows, where the variable names including the <> should be replaced by above 4 values.

```json
{
  "clientId": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "tenantId": "<TENANT_ID>",
  "clientCredential": "<CLIENT_CREDENTIAL>",
  "workspaceId": "<WORKSPACE_ID>"
}
```

### Add secrets to the Key Vault

1. After creating the Key vault, under Objects click Keys and create a new key
2. Enter the values that were copied from App Registration Secrets above

- the name of the key **MUST** be `tenant`
- The _Secret Value_ will be the formatted secret value you created above
- Other settings can be left to default values

3. Add a new secret `datalake` with the value the following value

```json
{
  "dtlLongTermToken": "<DATALAKE_LONGTERM_TOKEN>"
}
```

4. (Only if using a certificate) Generate a new certificate for app registration.
   1. Under Objects click Certificates and create a new certificate
      - Select the Generate method
      - Name it `cert`
      - Enter a subject, for example: `"CN=<your-tenant>.onmicrosoft.com"`
      - Select PEM as Content Type
      - Other settings can be configured as needed
   2. Click on generated certificate and click _Download in CER format_. Remove the `.txt` extension from the downloaded file
   3. Go back to the app registration previously created
   4. Click on _Client & Secrets_ and go to _Certificates_
   5. Click on _Upload certificate_ and select the CER file you downloaded

## Function

This is how the create the Azure Function app.

### Create the Azure Function in the Azure Portal

1. Go to the service _Function App_
2. Click _Create_ to generate a new Azure Function

- Give the function a descriptive name
- Choose at Publish for _Code_, and _Python_ as the Runtime Stack. Again pay attention to the Region ("France Central")
- OS can remain Linux
- At plan type choose _App service plan_
- Other settings can be left to default values. Click _Review + Create_

3. Assign the correct RBAC to your Function so that it can access to secrets in Vault.

4. Go back to the Azure Function and click on _Configuration_
5. Add a new application setting with the name `tenant` and the Key Vault reference string `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://<keyvaultname>.vault.azure.net/secrets/tenant/)`
6. Add a new application setting with the name `datalake` and the Key Vault reference string `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://<keyvaultname>.vault.azure.net/secrets/datalake/)`
7. (Only if using a certificate) Add a new application setting with the name `certificate` and the Key Vault reference string `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://<keyvaultname>.vault.azure.net/certificates/cert/)`
8. Add a new application setting with the name `timerTriggerSchedule`
   - The `timerTriggerSchedule` takes a cron expression. For more information, see [Timer trigger for Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer?tabs=python-v2%2Cin-process&pivots=programming-language-python).
   - For example to run once every two hours cron expression: `0 */2 * * *`
9. Do the same for `log_file` and set it to `/tmp/datalake2sentinel.log`.
10. In some case you need to change the value of env variable `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` from `~4` to `~3`.

### Upload the Function Code with Visual Studio Code

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
3. Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder containing this repo
4. If not generated automatically, create the folder `.vscode` at the root of the repository folder and replace all its files with the one in [.vscode](../.vscode/).
5. Right click on the folder called `Azure Function` and select _Deploy to Function App..._
6. Select the Azure Function you created in the previous steps and click _Deploy_

## Validation

Once all above steps are completed, the Azure Function will retrieve data at the time you have scheduled your function to run.

1. Go to the service _Microsoft Sentinel_
2. At the left-hand side click _Threat Intelligence_
3. You should now get a list of thousands threat indicators, with **Datalake - OrangeCyberdefense** as the source
